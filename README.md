# rock-paper-scissors
Version 1.1.

This is my rock-paper-scissors project. The commit history until version 1 can be seen in the odin project repository under JS_Foundations/rock-paper-scissors.


Bugs fixed:
- buttons did not work on mobile and some desktop configurations (but worked on my device that I developed this one)
    - fixed this by using background images in css instead of embeding a link to my image within the buttons
